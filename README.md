# Sypher
Developed an android mobile application named Sypher. Sypher is a messenger application that helps users communicate with each other. Users can create their accounts or log in through their Google credentials. All their credentials will be stored in the Firebase real time database, thus allowing them to send and receive messages (including images) to/from their friends. A user will be able to view other userâ€™s profiles (which includes profile picture and other details). Apart from a chatting platform, each user is given an Inbox (which also distinguishes the read messages from the unread) where all his/her messages are stored. All the images data is stored in the Firebase Storage.
